# About

This blog is concerned with the intersection of technology (especially software development), political philosophy (especially the work of Marx), collective decision-making, and degrowth.

My name is Christopher Gibilisco and I am a software dev and (kind of) philosopher based in Lincoln, Nebraska. By day I help build web apps, by night [I mostly make tiny games on PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?uid=54244). My main languages are Ruby, C#, and Go. I am currently working on *Unseemly*, a tiny game where you play an evil demon deceiving Descartes. I also am looking into FOSS software projects to contribute to.

I received my PhD in philosophy from the University of Nebraska in 2016. My [dissertation](https://philarchive.org/rec/GIBTOP?all_versions=1) was on theory choice.
