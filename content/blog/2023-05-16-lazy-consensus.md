In the standard case, collective decisions are made by a group of people in a room together. This arrangement requires planning on the part of participants. Rooms need to be booked -- at an inn, a library, a community center, or someone's house. Schedules have to be accommodated. Refreshments have to be prepared.

As time has gone on, these requirements have lessened the need for spatial and temporal proximity between participants. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many of us to participate in collective decision-making from afar, via tools like Zoom, Teams, and Meet. Other communication tools like e-mail, Slack, and Discord allow us to conduct decision-making processes asynchronously, through voice and text messages. Discussions can be continued over several days without the need for late-night discussions or repeated bookings and reschedulings.

Obviously, not all collective decision-making can be done this way. Some things need all participants together, as the decisions may need to be made rapidly and require everyone present. For example, two people cutting down a tree need to both be present to make decisions related to what cuts to make, as they are actively cutting the tree.
